garden funny footpath the little sticks standing the ends the rows labelled `` lettuce '' `` beets '' `` helianthus '' `` I a garden I a garden '' Margery 's last thought she went dreamland THE LITTLE COTYLEDONS This another story Margery 's garden The next morning the garden planted Margery six o'clock She could not wait look her garden To sure she knew the seeds could not sprout a single night she a feeling _something_ might happen any moment The garden just smooth brown the night little seedlings sight But a mornings Margery went she saw a funny little crack opening the earth the whole length the patch Quickly she knelt the footpath see Yes Tiny green leaves a whole row pushing their way the crust Margery knew she put there the radish-row must radish leaves She examined closely she might know a radish next time The little leaves bigger half little-finger nail grew twos -- two each tiny stem they almost round Margery flew back her mother say the first seeds And her mother nearly excited Margery came look the little crack Each day the row radishes grew till a week stood high finger green sturdy But the third day Margery stooping the radishes she saw something small green peeping ground the lettuce planted Could weeds No looking closely she saw the wee leaves faintly marked a regular row They did not make a crack like the radishes they seemed too small too far apart push the earth like Margery leaned looked all her eyes the baby plants The tiny leaves grew two a stem almost round The she looked the seemed Margery they looked exactly the radish looked first came `` Do you suppose '' Margery said herself `` lettuce radish look alike they growing They n't look alike they the table '' Day day the lettuce grew soon the little round leaves easier examine they certainly very much like radish leaves Then one morning she searching signs other seeds Margery discovered the beets In irregular patches the row hints green coming The next day the next they grew the beet leaves big enough see Margery looked Then she looked Then she wrinkled her forehead `` Can made a mistake '' she thought `` Do you suppose planted _all_ radishes '' For those little beet leaves almost round they grew two a stem precisely like the lettuce the radish except the size all three rows looked alike It too much Margery She ran the house found her father Her little face anxious thought something unpleasant happened `` Papa '' she said all breath `` do you think could made a mistake my garden Do you think we could put radishes all the rows '' Father laughed `` What makes you think such a thing '' asked `` Papa '' said Margery `` the little leaves all look exactly alike every plant just two tiny leaves shaped the same they roundish grow the stem the same place '' Papa 's eyes began twinkle `` Many the dicotyledonous plants look alike the beginning '' said a little drawl the big word That tease Margery she always wanted know the big words she heard `` What 's 'dicotyledonous '' said Margery carefully `` Wait till I come home to-night dear '' said her father `` I 'll tell you '' That evening Margery waiting eagerly When her father finished supper they went together the garden father examined the seedlings carefully Then pulled a little radish plant a tiny beet `` These little leaves '' said `` not the real leaves the plant they little pockets hold food the plant live till gets strong enough push the air As soon the real leaves come begin draw food the air little substitutes wither fall off These two lie folded the little seed the beginning full plant food They don't very special shape you see they do n't stay the plant grown '' `` Then every plant looks like this first '' said Margery `` No dear not every one plants divided two kinds those two food leaves like plants those one called dicotyledonous the ones one food leaf monocotyledonous Many the dicotyledons look alike '' `` I think interesting '' said Margery `` I always supposed the plants different the minute they began grow '' `` Indeed '' said father `` Even the trees look like this they first come you would not think a birch tree could look like a vegetable a flower would you But does first it looks much like things the great nurseries trees raised forests parks the workmen very carefully trained else they would pull the trees they weeding They taught the difference a birch tree a weed '' `` How funny '' said Margery dimpling `` Yes it sounds funny '' said father `` you see the birch tree dicotyledonous many weeds the dicotyledons look so much alike first '' `` I glad know father '' said Margery soberly `` I believe I shall learn a good deal living the country do n't you think so '' Margery 's father took her arms `` I hope so dear '' said `` the country a good place little girls '' And all happened day THE TALKATIVE TORTOISE Once upon a time a Tortoise lived a pond two Ducks her very good friends She enjoyed the company the Ducks she could talk her heart 's content the Tortoise liked talk She always something say she liked hear herself say it After many years this pleasant living the pond became very low a dry season finally it dried The two Ducks saw they could longer live there so they decided fly another region there water They went the Tortoise bid her good-bye `` Oh do n't leave behind '' begged the Tortoise `` Take you I must die I left here '' `` But you not fly '' said the Ducks `` How we take you us '' `` Take you take you '' said the Tortoise The Ducks felt so sorry her last they thought a way take her `` We thought a way possible '' they said '' you can manage keep still long enough We each take hold one end a stout stick do you take the middle mouth then we fly the air you carry you us But remember not talk If you open your mouth you lost '' The Tortoise said she would not say a word she would not so much move her mouth she very grateful So the Ducks brought a strong little stick took hold the ends the Tortoise bit firmly the middle Then the two Ducks rose slowly the air flew away their burden When they the treetops the Tortoise wanted say `` How high we '' But she remembered kept still When they passed the church steeple she wanted say `` What shines '' But she remembered held her peace Then they came the village square the people looked up saw `` Look the Ducks carrying a Tortoise '' they shouted every one ran look The Tortoise wanted say `` What business it yours '' But she did n't Then she heard the people shout `` Is n't it strange Look it Look '' The Tortoise forgot everything except she wanted say `` Hush you foolish people '' She opened her mouth -- fell the ground And the end the Tortoise It a very good thing able hold one 's tongue ROBERT OF SICILY An old legend says there once a king named Robert Sicily brother the Great Pope Rome the Emperor Allemaine He a very selfish king very proud cared pleasures the needs people heart so filled greatness thought God One day this proud king sitting place church vesper service courtiers their bright garments dressed royal robes The choir chanting the Latin service the beautiful voices swelled louder the king noticed one particular verse seemed repeated He turned a learned clerk side asked those words meant knew Latin `` They mean 'He hath put the mighty their seats hath exalted low degree '' answered the clerk `` It well the words Latin then '' said the king angrily `` they are a lie There power earth heaven can put my seat '' sneered the beautiful singing leaned back place Presently the king fell asleep the service went He slept deeply long When awoke the church dark still all alone He the king left alone the church awake the dark He furious rage surprise stumbling the dim aisles reached the great doors beat madly shouting servants The old sexton heard one shouting pounding the church thought it drunken vagabond stolen the service He came the door keys called `` Who there '' `` Open open It I the king '' came a hoarse angry voice within `` It a crazy man '' thought the sexton frightened He opened the doors carefully stood back peering the darkness Out past rushed the figure a man tattered scanty clothes unkempt hair white wild face The sexton did not know ever seen looked long wondering wildness haste In fluttering rags without hat cloak not knowing strange thing happened King Robert rushed palace gates pushed aside the startled servants hurried blind rage up the wide stair the great corridors toward the room could hear the sound courtiers voices Men women servants tried stop the ragged man somehow got the palace Robert did not even see fled along Straight the open doors the big banquet hall made way the midst the grand feast there The great hall filled lights flowers the tables set everything delicate rich eat the courtiers their gay clothes laughing talking the head the feast the king 's throne sat a king His face figure voice exactly like Robert Sicily human could told the difference one dreamed not the king He dressed the king 's royal robes wore the royal crown hand the king 's ring Robert Sicily half naked ragged without a sign kingship stood the throne stared fury this figure The king the throne looked `` Who art thou dost thou here '' asked And though voice just like Robert 's it something it sweet deep like the sound bells `` I the king '' cried Robert Sicily `` I the king you are impostor '' The courtiers started their seats drew their swords They would killed the crazy man insulted their king raised hand stopped eyes looking Robert 's eyes said `` Not the king you shall the king 's jester You shall wear the cap bells make laughter my court You shall the servant the servants your companion shall the jester 's ape '' With shouts laughter the courtiers drove Robert Sicily the banquet hall the waiting-men laughter too pushed the soldiers hall there the pages brought the jester 's wretched ape put a fool 's cap bells Robert 's head It like a terrible dream could not believe it true could not understand happened And woke next morning believed it a dream king But turned head felt the coarse straw cheek instead the soft pillow saw the stable the shivering ape side Robert Sicily a jester one knew the king Three long years passed Sicily happy all things went well the king not Robert Robert still the jester heart grew harder bitter every year Many times the three years the king face voice called none else could hear asked the one question '' Who art thou '' And each time asked it eyes looked Robert 's eyes find heart But each time Robert threw back his head answered proudly `` I the king '' And the other king 's eyes grew sad stern At the end three years the Pope called the Emperor Allemaine the King Sicily his brothers a great meeting his city Rome The King Sicily went all his soldiers courtiers servants -- a great procession horsemen footmen Never there seen a finer sight the grand train men bright armour riders wonderful cloaks velvet silk servants carrying marvellous presents the Pope And the very end rode Robert the jester His horse poor old many-coloured the ape rode Every one the villages through they passed ran the jester pointed laughed The Pope received his brothers their trains the square Saint Peter 's With music flags flowers made the King Sicily welcome greeted his brother In the midst it the jester broke through the crowd threw the Pope `` Look '' cried `` I your brother Robert Sicily This man impostor stolen my throne I Robert the king '' The Pope looked the poor jester pity the Emperor Allemaine turned the King Sicily said `` Is it not rather dangerous brother keep a madman jester '' And Robert pushed back among the serving-men It Holy Week the king the emperor all their trains went every day the great services the cathedral Something wonderful holy seemed make services beautiful ever All the people Rome felt it it the presence an angel there Men thought God felt His blessing But one knew it brought the beautiful feeling And Easter Day came never there so lovely so holy a day the great churches filled flowers sweet incense the kneeling people listened the choirs singing it like the voices angels their prayers earnest ever their praise glad there something heavenly Rome Robert Sicily went the services the rest sat the humblest place the servants Over heard the sweet voices the choirs chant the Latin words heard long ago _He hath put the mighty their seat hath exalted low degree_ And last listened his heart softened He too felt the strange blessed presence a heavenly power He thought God his wickedness remembered selfish little good done realised his power not all On Easter night crept his bed straw wept not so wretched not a better king power his At last all the festivities the King Sicily went home his land his people Robert the jester came home too On the day their home-coming there a special service the royal church even the service over the people the monks held prayers thanksgiving praise The sound their singing came softly the palace windows In the great banquet room the king sat wearing his royal robes his crown many subjects came greet At last sent all away saying wanted alone commanded the jester stay And they alone together the king looked Robert 's eyes done said softly `` Who art thou '' Robert Sicily bowed his head `` Thou knowest best '' said `` I know I sinned '' As spoke heard the voices the monks singing _He hath put the mighty their seat_ -- his head sank lower But suddenly the music seemed change a wonderful light shone all As Robert raised his eyes saw the face the king smiling a radiance like nothing earth sank his knees the glory smile a voice sounded the music like a melody throbbing a single string -- '' I an angel thou art the king '' Then Robert Sicily alone His royal robes upon once wore his crown his royal ring He king And the courtiers came back they found their king kneeling his throne absorbed silent prayer THE JEALOUS COURTIERS I wonder you ever heard the anecdote the artist Duesseldorf the jealous courtiers This it It seems there once a very famous artist lived the little town Duesseldorf He did such fine work the Elector Prince Johann Wilhelm ordered a portrait statue horseback done bronze The artist overjoyed the commission worked early late the statue At last the work done the artist the great statue set up the public square Duesseldorf ready the opening view The Elector came the appointed day came his favourite courtiers the castle Then the statue unveiled It very beautiful -- so beautiful the prince exclaimed surprise He could not look enough presently turned the artist shook hands like an old friend `` Herr Grupello '' said `` you are a great artist this statue make your fame even greater it the portrait perfect '' When the courtiers heard this saw the friendly hand-shake their jealousy the artist beyond bounds Their one thought could they safely do something humiliate They dared not pick flaws the portrait statue the prince declared it perfect But last one said an air great frankness `` Indeed Herr Grupello the portrait his Royal Highness perfect permit say the statue the horse not quite so successful the head too large it proportion '' `` No '' said another `` the horse really not so successful the turn the neck there awkward '' `` If you would change the right hind-foot Herr Grupello '' said a third '' it would be an improvement '' Still another found fault the horse 's tail The artist listened quietly When they all finished turned the prince said `` Your courtiers prince find a good many flaws the statue the horse you permit keep it a days more do I can it '' The Elector assented the artist ordered a temporary screen be built around the statue so his assistants could work undisturbed For several days the sound hammering came steadily behind the enclosure The courtiers took care pass way often delighted Each one said `` I must have been right really the artist sees something wrong I shall have credit saving the prince 's portrait my artistic taste '' Once more the artist summoned the prince his courtiers once more the statue unveiled Again the Elector exclaimed its beauty then turned his courtiers one another see they say `` Perfect '' said the first `` Now the horse 's head proportion there not a flaw '' `` The change the neck just needed '' said the second `` it very graceful '' `` The rear right foot it be '' said a third `` it adds so much the beauty the whole '' The fourth said considered the tail greatly improved `` My courtiers are much pleased '' said the prince Herr Grupello '' they think the statue much improved the changes you have made '' Herr Grupello smiled a little `` I glad they are pleased '' said '' the fact I have changed nothing '' `` What do you mean '' said the prince surprise `` Have we not heard the sound hammering every day What you hammering then '' `` I hammering the reputation your courtiers found fault simply they jealous '' said the artist `` And I rather think their reputation pretty well hammered pieces '' It indeed The Elector laughed heartily the courtiers slunk away one another without a word PRINCE CHERRY There once an old king so wise kind true the most powerful good fairy his land visited asked name the dearest wish his heart she might grant it `` Surely you know it '' said the good king `` it my son Prince Cherry do whatever you would have done '' `` Gladly '' said the great fairy `` choose I shall give I can make the richest the most

unless wills it '' The king sad hear this rejoiced the friendship the fairy his son And died soon happy know he left Prince Cherry her hands Prince Cherry grieved his father often lay awake night thinking One night he all alone his room a soft lovely light suddenly shone a beautiful vision stood his side It the good fairy She clad robes dazzling white her shining hair she wore a wreath white roses `` I the Fairy Candide '' she said the prince `` I promised your father I would be your best friend long you live I shall watch over your happiness I have brought you a gift it not wonderful look it a wonderful power your welfare wear it let it help you '' As she spoke she placed a small gold ring the prince 's little finger `` This ring '' she said `` help you be good you do evil it prick you remind you If you do not heed its warnings a worse thing happen you I shall become your enemy '' Then she vanished Prince Cherry wore his ring said nothing anyone the fairy's gift It did not prick a long time because he good merry happy But Prince Cherry been rather spoiled his nurse he a child she always said he should become king he could do exactly he pleased Now a he began find this not true it made angry The first time he noticed even a king could not always have his way a day he went hunting It happened he got game This put such a bad temper he grumbled scolded all the way home The little gold ring began feel tight uncomfortable When he reached the palace his pet dog ran meet `` Go away '' said the prince crossly But the little dog so used petted he jumped up his master tried kiss his hand The prince turned kicked the little creature At the instant he felt a sharp prick his little finger like a pin prick `` What nonsense '' said the prince himself `` Am I not king the whole land May I not kick my dog I choose What evil there '' A silver voice spoke his ear `` The king the land a right do good not evil you have been guilty bad temper cruelty to-day see you do better to-morrow '' The prince turned sharply no one be seen yet he recognised the voice Fairy Candide He followed her advice a little presently he forgot the ring pricked so sharply his finger a drop blood it This happened the prince grew more self-willed headstrong every day he bad friends too urged the hope he would ruin himself give a chance seize the throne He treated his people carelessly his servants cruelly everything he wanted he felt he must have The ring annoyed terribly it embarrassing a king have a drop blood his finger all the time At last he took the ring off put it sight Then he thought he should be perfectly happy his way instead he grew more unhappy he grew less good Whenever he crossed could not have his way instantly he flew a passion Finally he wanted something he really could not have This time it a most beautiful young girl named Zelia the prince saw her loved her so much he wanted once make her his queen To his great astonishment she refused `` Am I not pleasing you '' asked the prince surprise `` You are very handsome very charming prince '' said Zelia `` you are not like the good king your father I fear you would make very miserable I your queen '' In a

the shape those beasts whom you resemble '' With horror the prince felt himself transformed a monster He tried rush upon the fairy kill her she vanished her words As he stood her voice came the air saying sadly '' Learn conquer your pride being submission your subjects '' At the same moment Prince Cherry felt himself being transported a distant forest he set a clear stream In the water he saw his terrible image he the head a lion bull 's horns the feet a wolf a tail like a serpent And he gazed horror the fairy 's voice whispered `` Your soul become more ugly your shape you have deformed it

know dears the old countries there are many fine stories things happened so very long ago nobody knows exactly much them is true Ireland is like It is so old even long ago four thousand years it had people dug the mines knew weave cloth make beautiful ornaments gold could fight make laws we do not know just they came exactly they lived These people left us some splendid stories about their kings their fights their beautiful women it all happened such a long time ago the stories are mixtures things really happened what people said about them we do n't know just is The stories are called _legends_ One the prettiest legends is the story I going tell you about the Dagda 's harp It is said there were two quite different kinds people Ireland one set people long dark hair dark eyes called Fomorians -- they carried long slender spears made golden bronze when they fought -- another race people were golden-haired blue-eyed carried short blunt heavy spears dull metal The golden-haired people had a great chieftain was also a kind high priest was called the Dagda And this Dagda had a wonderful magic harp The harp was beautiful look upon mighty size made rare wood ornamented gold jewels it had wonderful music its strings the Dagda could call When the men were going battle the Dagda would set up his magic harp sweep his hand across the strings a war song would ring which would make every warrior buckle his armour brace his knees shout `` Forth the fight '' Then when the men came back the battle weary wounded the Dagda would take his harp strike a few chords the magic music stole upon the air every man forgot his weariness the smart his wounds thought the honour he had the comrade had died beside the safety his wife children Then the song would swell louder every warrior would remember the glory he had helped win the king each man would rise at the great table his cup his hand shout `` Long live the King '' There came a time when the Fomorians the golden-haired men were at war the midst a great battle the Dagda 's hall was not so well guarded usual some the chieftains the Fomorians stole the great harp the wall it hung fled away it Their wives children some few their soldiers went them they fled fast far through the night they were a long way the battlefield Then they thought they were safe they turned aside a vacant castle by the road sat a banquet hanging the stolen harp the wall The Dagda two three his warriors had followed hard their track And they were the midst their banqueting the door was suddenly burst open the Dagda stood there his men Some the Fomorians sprang their feet any them could grasp a weapon the Dagda called his harp the wall `` Come O my harp '' The great harp recognised its master 's voice leaped the wall Whirling through the hall sweeping aside killing the men got its way it sprang its master 's hand And the Dagda took his harp swept his hand across the strings three great solemn chords The harp answered the magic Music Tears As the wailing harmony smote upon the air the women the Fomorians bowed their heads wept bitterly the strong men turned their faces aside the little children sobbed Again the Dagda touched the strings this time the magic Music Mirth leaped the harp And when they heard Music Mirth the young warriors the Fomorians began laugh they laughed till the cups fell their grasp the spears dropped their hands the wine flowed the broken bowls they laughed their limbs were helpless excess glee Once more the Dagda touched his harp very very softly And a music stole forth soft dreams sweet joy it was the magic Music Sleep When they heard gently gently the Fomorian women bowed their heads slumber the little children crept their mothers laps the old men nodded the young warriors drooped their seats closed their eyes one another all the Fomorians sank sleep When they were all deep slumber the Dagda took his magic harp he his golden-haired warriors stole softly away came in safety their own homes again THE TAILOR AND THE THREE BEASTS There was once a tailor in Galway he started a journey go the king 's court at Dublin He had not gone far when he met a white horse he saluted `` God save you '' said the tailor `` God save you '' said the horse `` Where are you going '' `` I going Dublin '' said the tailor `` build a court the king get a lady a wife if I able do it '' For it seems the king had promised his daughter a great lot money anyone should be able build up his court The trouble was three giants lived in the wood near the court every night they came the wood threw all was built by day So nobody could get the court built `` Would you make me a hole '' said the old white garraun `` I could go in hide whenever the people come fetch me the mill the kiln so they wo n't see me they tire me out doing work them '' `` I 'll do indeed '' said the tailor `` welcome '' He brought his spade shovel he made a hole he asked the old white horse go it so he could see if it would fit The white horse went into the hole when he tried come up again he was not able `` Make a place me '' said the white horse `` by which I can come up out the hole here whenever I hungry '' `` I not '' said the tailor `` remain you are I come back I 'll lift you up '' The tailor went forward next day the fox met `` God save you '' said the fox `` God save you '' said the tailor `` Where are you going '' said the fox `` I 'm going Dublin try make a court the king '' `` Would you make a place me I can hide '' said the fox `` The rest the foxes are always beating me they not allow me eat anything them '' `` I 'll do you '' said the tailor He took his axe his saw he made a thing like a crate he told the fox get into it so he could see whether it would fit The fox went into it when the tailor had down he shut in When the fox was satisfied at last he had a nice place it within he asked the tailor let out the tailor answered he would not `` Wait there I come back again '' said he The tailor went forward the next day he had not walked very far when he met a lion the lion greeted `` God save you '' said the lion `` God save you '' said the tailor `` Where are you going '' said the lion `` I 'm going Dublin make a court the king if I able make it '' said the tailor `` If you were make a plough me '' said the lion `` I the other lions could be ploughing harrowing we 'd have a bit eat in the harvest '' `` I 'll do you '' said the tailor He brought his axe his saw he made a plough When the plough was made he put a hole in the beam it got the lion go in the plough so he might see if he was any good a ploughman He placed the lion 's tail in the hole he had made it then clapped in a peg the lion was not able draw out his tail again `` Loose me now '' said the lion `` we 'll fix go ploughing '' The tailor said he would not loose he came back himself He left there then he came Dublin When he arrived he engaged workmen began build the court At the end the day he had the workmen put a great stone top the work When the great stone was raised up the tailor put some sort contrivance it he might be able throw it down soon the giants came near it The workpeople then went home the tailor went in hiding behind the big stone When the darkness the night was come he saw the three giants arriving they began throwing down the court until they arrived at the place the tailor was in hiding up one them struck a blow his sledge the place he was The tailor threw down the stone it fell killed The other two went home then left all the court was remaining without throwing it down since their companion was dead The workmen came again the next day they were working until night they were going home the tailor told them put up the big stone the top the work it had been the night They did went home the tailor went in hiding the same he did the evening When the people had all gone rest the two giants came they were throwing down all was them soon they began the tailor commenced manoeuvring until he was able throw down the great stone so it fell upon the skull the giant was it killed After this there was the one giant left he never came again until the court was finished Then when the work was over the tailor went the king told give him his wife his money as he had the court finished the king said he would not give him any wife until he had killed the other giant he said it was not by his strength he had killed the two giants he would give him nothing now until he killed the other one him Then the tailor said he would kill the other giant him welcome there should be no delay at all about The tailor went then till he came the place the other giant was asked did he want a servant-boy The giant said he did want one if he could get one would do everything he would do himself `` Anything you will do I will do '' said the tailor They went their dinner then when they had eaten it the giant asked the tailor `` would he dare swallow as much boiling broth as himself '' The tailor said `` I will certainly do you must give me an hour we commence '' The tailor went out then he got a sheepskin which he sewed up until he made a bag it he slipped it down under his coat He came in then told the giant first drink a gallon the broth himself The giant drank up it was boiling `` I 'll do '' said the tailor He went until it was all poured into the skin the giant thought he had drunk it The giant drank another gallon then the tailor let another gallon down into the skin the giant thought he was drinking it `` I 'll do a thing now you will not dare do '' said the tailor `` You will not '' said the giant `` What is it you would do '' `` Make a hole let out the broth again '' said the tailor `` Do it yourself first '' said the giant The tailor gave a prod the knife he let the broth out the skin `` Now you do '' said he `` I will '' said the giant giving such a prod the knife into his own stomach he killed himself That is the way the tailor killed the third giant He went the king then desired him send him out his wife his money saying he would throw down the court again if he did not do so immediately They were afraid then he would throw down the court they sent the wife him When the tailor was a day gone himself his wife they repented followed him take his wife away him again The people went him followed him until they came the place where the lion was the lion said them `` The tailor his wife were here yesterday I saw them going by if you will loose me now I swifter you I will follow them until I overtake them '' When they heard they released the lion The lion the people Dublin went pursued the tailor until they came the place where the fox was the fox greeted them said `` The tailor his wife were here this morning if you will loose me I swifter

garraun was the old white garraun told them the tailor his wife were there in the morning `` Loose me '' said he `` I swifter you I 'll overtake them '' They released the old white garraun then the old white garraun the fox the lion the army Dublin pursued the tailor his wife it was not long they came up them When the tailor saw them coming he got out the coach his wife he sat down the ground When the old white garraun saw the tailor sitting the ground he said `` That 's the position he was in when he made the hole me that I could n't get out when I went down into it I 'll go no nearer him '' `` No '' said the fox `` that 's the way he was when he was making the thing me I 'll go no nearer him '' `` No '' says the lion `` that 's the very way he had when he was making the plough that I was caught in I 'll go no nearer him '' They all left him then returned The tailor his wife came home Galway HOW THE SEA BECAME SALT This story was told long ago by our Northern forefathers brought it them in their dragon ships when they crossed the North Sea settle in England In those days men were apt invent stories account things about them which seemed peculiar loving the sea as they did it is not strange that they had remarked the peculiarity the ocean water had found a reason it is so different the water in the rivers steams This is not the story that come down tell us people old accounted the sea being salt There are many such stories each different the other all showing that the same childlike spirit inquiry was at work in different places striving find an answer this riddle nature There sprang the sons Odin a race men became mighty kings the earth one these named Frode ruled over the lands that are called Denmark Now about this time were found in Denmark two great millstones so large that no one had the strength turn them So Frode sent all the wise men the land bade them examine the stones tell him what use they were since no one could grind them And the wise men had looked closely at them read the magic letters which were cut upon their edge they said that the millstones were precious indeed since they would grind out nothing anything that the miller might wish So King Frode sent messengers over the world find him two servants would be strong enough grind the millstones a long long time his messengers found him two maid-servants were bigger stronger anyone in Denmark had ever seen But no one guessed that these were really Giant-Maidens bore a grudge all the race Odin Directly the Giant-Maidens were brought Frode they had rested their long journey satisfied their hunger he bade them go the mill grind him gold peace happiness `` They sang swung The swift mill stone And loud voice They made their moan 'We grind Frode Wealth gold Abundant riches He shall behold '' Presently Frode came into the mill see that the new servants were performing their task diligently And as he watched them the shadow by the door the maidens stayed their grinding a rest The greedy man could not bear see even an instant 's pause he came out the shadow bade them harsh words go grinding cease not except so long as the cuckoo was silent while he himself sang a song Now it was early summer-time the cuckoo was calling all the day most the night So the Giant-Maidens waxed very wroth King Frode as they resumed their labours they sang a song the hardness their lot in the household this pitiless King They had been grinding out wealth happiness peace now they bade the magic stones grind something very different Presently as the great stones moved round round Frode still stood by heard one chant in a low sing-song voice -- '' I see a fire east the town -- the curlews awake sound a note warning A host approaches in haste burn the dwelling the king '' And the next took up her song -- '' No longer will Frode sit his throne rule over rings red gold mighty millstones Now must we grind all our might -- behold red warriors come forth -- revenge bloodshed ruin '' Then Frode shook head foot in his terror he heard the tramp a mighty host warriors advancing the sea And as he looked a way escape the braces the millstones broke the strong grinding fell in two And the whole world shook trembled the mighty shock that breaking But through the crash din came the voices the Giant-Maidens loudly chanting -- `` We have turned the stone round Though weary the maidens See what they have ground '' And that same night a mighty sea-king came up slew Frode plundered his city When he had sacked the city the sea-king took board his ship the two Giant-Maidens them the broken millstones And he bade them begin at once grind salt this he had very scanty store So they ground ground in the middle the night being weary they asked the sea-king if he had not got salt enough But the sea-king was hard heart like Frode he roughly bade them go grinding And the maidens did so worked such effect that within a short time the millstones had ground out so much salt that the weight it began sink the ship Down down it sank ship giants millstones in that spot in the very middle the ocean arose a whirlpool whence the salt is carried north south east west throughout the waters the earth And that is how the sea became salt THE CASTLE OF FORTUNE One lovely summer morning just as the sun rose two travellers started a journey They were strong young men one was a lazy fellow the other was a worker As the first sunbeams came over the hills they shone a great castle standing the heights as far away as the eye could see It was a wonderful beautiful castle all glistening towers that gleamed like marble glancing windows that shone like crystal The two young men looked at it eagerly longed go nearer Suddenly out the distance something like a great butterfly white gold swept toward them And when it came nearer they saw that it was a most beautiful lady robed in floating garments as fine as cobwebs wearing her head a crown so bright that no one could tell whether it was diamonds dew She stood light as air a great shining golden ball which rolled along her swifter the wind As she passed the travellers she turned her face them smiled `` Follow me '' she said The lazy man sat down in the grass a discontented sigh `` She an easy time it '' he said But the industrious man ran the lovely lady caught the hem her floating robe in his grasp `` Who are you whither are you going '' he asked `` I the Fairy Fortune '' the beautiful lady said `` that is my castle You may reach it to-day if you will there is time if you waste none If you reach it the last stroke midnight I will receive you there will be your friend But if you come one second midnight it will be too late '' When she had said this her robe slipped the traveller 's hand she was gone The industrious man hurried back his friend told him what the fairy had said `` The idea '' said the lazy man he laughed `` course if we had a horse there would be some chance _walk_ all that way No thank you '' `` Then good-bye '' said his friend `` I off '' And he set out down the road toward the shining castle a good steady stride his eyes straight ahead The lazy man lay down in the soft grass looked rather wistfully at the far-away towers `` If only I had a good horse '' he sighed Just at that moment he felt something warm nosing about at his shoulder heard a little whinny He turned round there stood a little horse It was a dainty creature gentle-looking finely built it was saddled bridled `` Hello '' said the lazy man `` Luck often comes when one is n't looking it '' And in an instant he had leaped the horse headed him the castle fortune The little horse started at a fine pace in a very few minutes they overtook the other traveller plodding along foot `` How do you like shank 's pony '' laughed the lazy man as he passed his friend The industrious man only nodded kept his steady stride eyes straight ahead The horse kept his good pace by noon the towers the castle stood out the sky much nearer more beautiful Exactly at noon the horse turned aside the road into a shady grove a hill stopped `` Wise beast '' said his rider `` 'haste makes waste all things are better in moderation I 'll follow your example eat rest a bit '' He dismounted sat down in the cool moss with his back a tree He had a lunch in his traveller 's pouch he ate it comfortably Then he felt drowsy the heat the early ride so he pulled his hat over his eyes settled himself a nap `` It will go all the better a little rest '' he said That _was_ a sleep He slept like the seven sleepers he dreamed the most beautiful things you could imagine At last he dreamed that he had entered the castle fortune was being received with great festivities Everything he wanted was brought him music played while fireworks were set off in his honour The music was so loud that he awoke He sat up rubbing his eyes behold the fireworks were the very last rays the setting sun the music was the voice the other traveller passing the grove foot `` Time be off '' said the lazy man looked about him the pretty horse No horse was be found The only living thing near was an old bony grey donkey The man called whistled looked no little horse appeared After a long while he gave it up since there was nothing better do he mounted the old grey donkey set out again The donkey was slow he was hard ride he was better nothing gradually the lazy man saw the towers the castle draw nearer Now it began to grow dark in the castle windows the lights began to show Then came trouble Slower slower went the grey donkey slower slower till in the very middle a pitch-black wood he stopped stood still Not a step would he budge all the coaxing scolding beating his rider could give At last the rider kicked him as well as beat him at that the donkey felt that he had had enough Up went his hind heels down went his head over it went the lazy man to the stony ground There he lay groaning many minutes it was not a soft place I can assure you How he wished he were in a soft warm bed with his aching bones comfortable in blankets The very thought it made him remember the Castle Fortune he knew there must be fine beds there To get to those beds he was even willing to bestir his poor limbs so he sat up felt about him the donkey No donkey was to be found The lazy man crept round round the spot where he had fallen scratched his hands the stumps tore his face in the briers bumped his knees on the stones But no donkey was there He would have laid down to sleep again he could hear now the howls hungry wolves in the woods that it did not sound pleasant Finally his hand struck something that felt like a saddle He grasped it thankfully started to mount his donkey The beast he took hold seemed very small as he mounted he felt that its sides were moist slimy It gave him a shudder he hesitated at that moment he heard a distant clock strike It was striking eleven There was still time to reach the castle fortune no more enough so he mounted his new steed rode on once more The animal was easier to sit on the donkey the saddle seemed remarkably high behind it was good to lean But even the donkey was not so slow as this the new steed was slower he After a while however he pushed his way out the woods into the open there stood the castle only a little way ahead All its windows were ablaze with lights A ray them fell on the lazy man 's beast he saw what he was riding it was a gigantic snail a snail as large as a calf A cold shudder ran over the lazy man 's body he would have got off his horrid animal then there just then the clock struck once more It was the first the long slow strokes that mark midnight The man grew frantic when he heard it He drove his heels into the snail's sides to make him hurry Instantly the snail drew in his head curled up in his shell left the lazy man sitting in a heap on the ground The clock struck twice If the man had run it he could still have reached the castle instead he sat still shouted a horse `` A beast a beast '' he wailed `` any kind a beast that will take me to the castle '' The clock struck three times And as it struck the third note something came rustling rattling out the darkness something that sounded like a horse with harness The lazy man jumped on its back a very queer low back As he mounted he saw the doors the castle open saw his friend standing on the threshold waving his cap beckoning to him The clock struck four times the new steed began to stir as it struck five he moved a pace forward as it struck six he stopped as it struck seven he turned himself about as it struck eight he began to move backward away the castle The lazy man shouted beat him the beast went slowly backward And the clock struck nine The man tried to slide off then all sides his strange animal great arms came reaching up held him fast And in the next ray moonlight that broke the dark clouds he saw that he was mounted on a monster crab One by one the lights went out in the castle windows The clock struck ten Backward went the crab Eleven Still the crab went backward The clock struck twelve Then the great doors shut with a clang the castle fortune was closed ever to the lazy man What became him his crab no one knows to this day no one cares But the industrious man was received by the Fairy Fortune made happy in the castle as long as he wanted to stay And ever afterward she was his friend helping him not only to happiness himself also showing him how to help others wherever he went DAVID AND GOLIATH A long time ago there was a boy named David lived in a country in the Far East He was good to look upon he had fair hair a ruddy skin he was very strong brave modest He was shepherd-boy his father all day -- often all night -- he was out in the fields far home watching over the sheep He had to guard them wild animals lead them to the right pastures care them By by war broke out the people David 's country a people that lived near at hand these men were called Philistines the people David 's country were named Israelites All the strong men Israel went up to the battle to fight their king David 's three older brothers went he was only a boy so he was left behind to care the sheep After the brothers had been gone some time David 's father longed very much to hear them to know if they were safe so he sent David from the fields said to him `` Take now thy brothers an ephah this parched corn these ten loaves run to the camp where thy brothers are carry these ten cheeses to the captain their thousand see how thy brothers fare bring me word again '' An ephah is about three pecks David rose early in the morning left the sheep with a keeper took the corn the loaves the cheeses as his father had commanded him went to the camp the Israelites The camp stood on a mountain on the one side the Philistines stood on a mountain on the other side there was a valley David came to the place where the Israelites were just as the host was going forth to the fight shouting the battle So he left his gifts in the hands the keeper the baggage ran into the army amongst the soldiers to find his brothers When he found them he saluted them began to talk with them But while he was asking them the questions his father had commanded there arose a great shouting tumult among the Israelites men came running back from the front line battle everything became confusion David looked to see what the trouble was he saw a strange sight down the slope the opposite mountain came striding a Philistine warrior calling out something in a taunting voice he was a gigantic man the largest David had ever seen he was covered with armour that shone in the sun he had a helmet brass upon his head he was armed with a coat mail he had greaves brass upon his legs a target brass between his shoulders his spear was so tremendous that the staff it was like a weaver 's beam his shield so great that a man went before him to carry it `` Who is that '' asked David `` It is Goliath Gath champion the Philistines '' said the soldiers about `` Every day forty days he has come forth so challenged us to send a man him in single combat since no one dares to go out him alone the armies can not fight '' That was one the laws warfare in those times `` What '' said David `` does none dare go out him '' As he spoke the giant stood still on the hillside opposite the host Israel shouted his challenge scornfully He said `` Why are ye come out to set your battle in array Am I not a Philistine ye servants Saul Choose you a man let him come down to me If he be able to fight with me to kill me then will we be your servants but if I prevail him kill him then shall ye be our servants serve us I defy the armies Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together '' When King Saul heard these words he was dismayed all the men Israel when they saw the man fled from him were sore afraid David heard them talking among themselves whispering and murmuring They were saying `` Have ye seen this man that is come up Surely if anyone killeth him that man will the king make rich perhaps he will give him his daughter in marriage and make his family free in Israel '' David heard this and he asked the men if it were so It was surely so they said `` But '' said David `` is this Philistine that he should defy the armies the living God '' And he was stirred with anger Very soon some the officers told the king about the youth was asking so many questions and said that it was shame upon Israel that a mere Philistine should defy the armies the living God Immediately Saul sent him When David came before Saul he said to the king `` Let no man 's heart fail because him thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine '' But Saul looked at David and said `` Thou art not able to go this Philistine to fight with him thou art but a youth and he has been a man war from his youth '' Then David said to Saul `` Once I was keeping my father 's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out the flock and I went out the lion and struck him and delivered the lamb out his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by the beard and struck him and slew him Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this Philistine shall be as one them he hath defied the armies the living God The Lord delivered me out the paw the lion and out the paw the bear he will deliver me out the hand this Philistine '' `` Go '' said Saul `` and the Lord be with thee '' And he armed David with his own armour -- he put a helmet brass upon his head and armed him with a coat mail But when David girded his sword upon his armour and tried to walk he said to Saul `` I can not go with these I not used to them '' And he put them off Then he took his staff in his hand and went and chose five smooth stones out the brook and put them in a shepherd 's bag which he had and his sling was in his hand and he went out and drew near to the Philistine And the Philistine came on and drew near to David and the man that bore his shield went before him And when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him David was but a boy and ruddy and a fair countenance And he said to David `` Am I a dog that thou comest to me with a cudgel '' And with curses he cried out again `` Come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls the air and to the beasts the field '' But David looked at him and answered `` Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name the Lord hosts the God the armies of Israel whom thou hast defied This day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand and I will smite thee and take thy head from thee and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear the battle is the Lord 's and he will give you into our hands '' And then when the Philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet David David made haste and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine And when he was a little way from him he put his hand in his bag and took from thence a stone and put it in his sling and slung it and smote the Philistine in the forehead so that the stone sank into his forehead and he fell on his face to the earth And David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and slew him with it Then when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead they fled But the army of Israel pursued them and victory was with the men of Israel And after the battle David was taken to the king 's tent and made a captain over many men and he went no more to his father 's house to herd the sheep but became a man in the king 's service THE SHEPHERD 'S SONG David had many fierce battles to fight King Saul against the enemies of Israel and he won them all Then later he had to fight against the king 's own soldiers to save himself King Saul grew wickedly jealous of David 's fame as a soldier and tried to kill him Twice when David had a chance to kill the king he forbore to harm him but even then Saul continued trying to take his life and David was kept away from his home as if he were an enemy But when King Saul died the people chose David their king because there was no one so brave so wise so faithful to God King David lived a long time and made his people famous victory and happiness he had many troubles and many wars but he always trusted that God would help him and he never deserted his own people in any hard place After a battle when it was a holiday when he was very thankful something King David used to make songs and sing them before the people Some of these songs were so beautiful that they have never been forgotten After all these hundreds and hundred of years we sing them still we call them Psalms Often after David had made a song his chief musician would sing with him as the people gathered to worship God Sometimes the singers were divided into two great choruses and went to the service in two processions then one chorus would sing a verse of David 's song and the other procession would answer with the next and then both would sing together it was very beautiful to hear Even now we sometimes do that with the songs of David in our churches One of his Psalms that everybody loves is a song that David made when he remembered the days before he came to Saul 's camp He remembered the days and nights he used to spend in the fields with the sheep when he was just a shepherd-boy and he thought to himself that God had taken care of him just as carefully as he himself used to care the little lambs It is a beautiful song I wish we knew the music that David made it but we only know his words I will tell it to you now and then you may learn it to say yourselves The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want He maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters He restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness his name 's sake Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord ever.= THE HIDDEN SERVANTS This is a legend about a hermit lived long ago He lived high up on the mountainside in a tiny cave his food was roots and acorns a bit of bread given by a peasant a cheese brought by a woman wanted his prayers his work was praying and thinking about God For forty years he lived so preaching to the people praying them comforting them in trouble and most of all worshipping in his heart There was just one thing he cared about it was to make his soul so pure and perfect that it could be one of the stones in God 's great Temple of Heaven One day after the forty years he had a great longing to know how far along he had got with his work -- how it looked to the Heavenly Father And he prayed that he might be shown a man -- `` Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown To the selfsame measure as his own Whose treasure on the celestial shore Could neither be less his more '' As he looked up from his prayer a white-robed angel stood in the path before him The hermit bowed before the messenger with great gladness for he knew that his wish was answered `` Go to the nearest town '' the angel said `` and there in the public square you will find a mountebank a clown making the people laugh for money He is the man you seek his soul has grown to the selfsame stature as your own his treasure on the celestial shore is neither less yours more '' When the angel had faded from sight the hermit bowed his head again but this time with great sorrow and fear Had his forty years of prayer been a terrible mistake and was his soul indeed like a clown fooling in the market-place He knew not what to think Almost he hoped he should not find the man and could believe that he had dreamed the angel vision But when he came after a long tiring walk to the village and the square alas there was the clown doing his silly tricks for the crowd The hermit stood and looked at him with terror and sadness for he felt that he was looking at his own soul The face he saw was thin and tired and though it kept a smile a grin for the people it seemed very sad to the hermit Soon the man felt the hermit 's eyes he could not go on with his tricks And when he had stopped and the crowd had left the hermit went and drew the man aside to a place where they could rest for he wanted more than anything else on earth to know what the man 's soul was like because what it was his was So after a little he asked the clown very gently what his life was what it had been And the clown answered very sadly that it was just as it looked -- a life of foolish tricks for that was the only way of earning his bread that he knew `` But have you never been anything different '' asked the hermit painfully The clown 's head sank in his hands `` Yes holy father '' he said `` I have been something else I was a thief I once belonged to the most wicked band of mountain robbers that ever tormented the land and I was as wicked as the worst '' Alas The hermit felt that his heart was breaking Was this how he looked to the Heavenly Father -- like a thief a cruel mountain robber He could hardly speak and the tears streamed from his old eyes but he gathered strength to ask one more question `` I beg you '' he said `` if you have ever done a single good deed in your life remember it now and tell it to me '' for he thought that even one good deed would save him from utter despair `` Yes one '' the clown said `` but it was so small it is not worth telling my life has been worthless '' `` Tell me that one '' pleaded the hermit `` Once '' said the man `` our band broke into a convent garden and stole away one of the nuns to sell as a slave to keep for a ransom We dragged her with us over the rough long way to our mountain camp and set a guard over her for the night The poor thing prayed to us so piteously to let her go And as she begged she looked from one hard face to another with trusting imploring eyes as if she could not believe men could be really bad Father when her eyes met mine something pierced my heart Pity and shame leaped up for the first time within me But I made my face as hard and cruel as the rest and she turned away hopeless `` When all was dark and still I stole like a cat to where she lay bound I put my hand on her wrist and whispered 'Trust me and I will take you safely home I cut her bonds with my knife and she looked at me to show that she trusted Father by terrible ways that I knew hidden from the others I took her safe to the convent gate She knocked they opened and she slipped inside And as she left me she turned and said 'God will remember `` That was all I could not go back to the old bad life and I had never learned an honest way to earn my bread So I became a clown and must be a clown until I die '' `` No no my son '' cried the hermit and now his tears were tears of joy `` God has remembered your soul is in his sight even as mine who have prayed and preached for forty years Your treasure waits for you on the heavenly shore just as mine does '' `` As _yours_ Father you mock me '' said the clown But when the hermit told him the story of his prayer and the angel's answer the poor clown was transfigured with joy for he knew that his sins were forgiven And when the hermit went home to his mountain the clown went with him He too became a hermit and spent his time in praise and prayer Together they lived and worked and helped the poor And when after two years the man who had been a clown died the hermit felt that he had lost a brother more holy than himself For ten years more the hermit lived in his mountain hut thinking always of God fasting and praying and doing no least thing that was wrong Then one day the wish once more came to know how his work was growing and once more he prayed that he might see a being -- `` Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown To the selfsame measure as his own Whose treasure on the celestial shore Could neither be less than his nor more '' Once more his prayer was answered The angel came to him and told him to go to a certain village on the other side of the mountain and to a small farm in it where two women lived In them he should find two souls like his own in God 's sight When the hermit came to the door of the little farm the two women who lived there were overjoyed to see him for everyone loved and honoured his name They put a chair for him on the cool porch and brought food and drink But the hermit was too eager to wait He longed greatly to know what the souls of the two women were like and from their looks he could see only that they were gentle and honest One was old and the other of middle age Presently he asked them about their lives They told him the little there was to tell they had worked hard always in the fields with their husbands or in the house they had many children they had seen hard times -- sickness sorrow but they had never despaired `` But what of your good deeds '' the hermit asked -- '' what have you done for God '' `` Very little '' they said sadly for they were too poor to give much To be sure twice every year when they killed a sheep for food they gave half to their poorer neighbours `` That is very good very faithful '' the hermit said `` And is there any other good deed you have done '' `` Nothing '' said the older woman `` unless unless -- it might be called a good deed -- -- '' She looked at the younger woman who smiled back at her `` What '' said the hermit Still the woman hesitated but at last she said timidly `` It is not much to tell father only this that it is twenty years since my sister-in-law and I came to live together in the house we have brought up our families here and in all the twenty years there has never been a cross word between us or a look that was less than kind '' The hermit bent his head before the two women and gave thanks in his heart `` If my soul is as these '' he said `` I blessed indeed '' And suddenly a great light came into the hermit 's mind and he saw how many ways there are of serving God Some serve him in churches and in hermits cells by praise and prayer some poor souls who have been very wicked turn from their wickedness with sorrow and serve him with repentance some live faithfully and gently in humble homes working bringing up children keeping kind and cheerful some bear pain patiently for His sake Endless endless ways there are that only the Heavenly Father sees And so as the hermit climbed the mountain again he thought -- `` As he saw the star-like glow Of light in the cottage windows far How many God 's hidden servants are '' LITTLE GOTTLIEB Across the North Sea in a country called Germany lived a little boy named Gottlieb His father had died when he was but a baby and although from early morning till late at night his mother sat plying her needle she found it difficult indeed to provide food and clothing and shelter for her little boy and herself Gottlieb was not old enough to work but he would often sit on a small stool at his mother 's feet and dream about the wonderful things he would do for his dear mother when he grew to be a man and she was comforted as she looked upon her boy and the thought that she was working for him often gave strength to her tired fingers But one night Gottlieb saw that his mother was more than usually troubled Every now and then she would sigh and a tear would trickle down her cheek The little boy had grown quick to read these signs of distress and he thought `` Christmas will be here soon and dear mother is thinking of what a sad time it will be '' What would Gottlieb have given to be able to comfort his mother He could only sit and brood while his young heart swelled and a lump rose in his throat at the thought that he could do nothing Presently however a happy fancy came to him Was not the Christ Child born on Christmas Day and did not He send good gifts to men on His birthday But then came the thought `` He will never find us Our home is so mean and small '' It seemed foolish to hope but a boy is not long cast down and as Gottlieb sat dreaming a happy inspiration came to him Stealing softly from the room he took paper and pen for he had learnt to write and spelt out word after word a letter which he addressed to the Christ Child You may be sure that the postman was puzzled what to do with this letter when he sorted it out of the heap in the letter-box Perhaps the Burgomaster would know the right thing to do So the postman took the letter to the great burly man who lived in the big house and wore a gold chain round his neck The Burgomaster opened the envelope and as he read the letter written in the trembling hand of a child tears came into his eyes But he spoke gruffly enough to the postman `` This must be a foolish boy a small one I have no doubt '' Soon Christmas morning dawned and Gottlieb woke very early But others were up before him for to his surprise he saw a strange gentleman with his mother His wondering eyes soon perceived other unusual objects for the hearth was piled with wood and the table was loaded with food and dainties such as he had never even imagined Gottlieb entered the room just as his mother threw herself at the stranger 's feet to bless him for his generous goodness to the widow and orphan `` Nay give me no thanks worthy dame '' said the visitor `` Rather be grateful to your little son and to the good Lord to whom he wrote for aid '' Then he turned to Gottlieb with a smile `` You see that although you wrote to the Christ Child your prayer for aid came only to the Burgomaster The gifts you asked for are here but they come from my hand '' But Gottlieb answered him humbly `` Nay sir the Christ Child sent them for He put the thought in your heart '' HOW THE FIR TREE BECAME THE CHRISTMAS TREE When you stand round the Christmas tree and look longingly at the toys hanging from the prickly branches it does not occur to you to ask it is always this particular tree that is so honoured at Christmas The dark green Fir looks so majestic when laden with bright toys and lit up by Christmas candles that perhaps it is not easy to believe that it is the most modest of trees But so it is and because of its humility it was chosen to bear Christmas gifts to the children This is the story When the Christ Child was born all people animals trees and other plants felt that a great happiness had come into the world And truly the Heavenly Father had sent with the Holy Babe His blessings of Peace and Goodwill to all Every day people came to see the sweet Babe bringing presents in their hands By the stable wherein lay the Christ Child stood three trees and as the people came and went under their spreading branches they thought that they too would like to give presents to the Child Said the Palm `` I will choose my biggest leaf and place it as a fan beside the manger to waft soft air to the Child '' `` And I '' said the Olive `` I will sprinkle sweet-smelling oil over Him '' `` What can I give to the Child '' asked the Fir `` You '' said the others `` You have nothing to offer Your needles would prick the wee Babe and your tears are sticky '' This made the poor Fir very unhappy indeed and it said sadly `` Yes you are right I have nothing that would be good enough to offer to the Christ Child '' Now quite near to the trees had stood an Angel who had heard all that had passed He was moved to pity the Fir who was so lowly and without envy of the other trees and he resolved to help it High in the dark of the heavens the stars were beginning to twinkle and the Angel begged some of the little ones to come down and rest upon the branches of the Fir This they were glad to do and their silvery light shone among the branches just like Christmas candles From where He lay the Christ Child could see the great dark evening world and the darker forms of the trees keeping watch like faithful guardians beside the open door of the stable and to its delight the Fir Tree saw the face of the Babe illumined with a heavenly smile as He looked upon the twinkling lights The Christ Child did not forget the lovely sight and long afterward he bade that to celebrate His birthday there should be placed in every house a Fir Tree which might be lit up with candles to shine for the children as the stars shone for Him on His first birthday Was not the Fir Tree richly rewarded for its meekness Surely there is no other tree that shines on so many happy faces THE DIAMOND AND THE DEWDROP A costly Diamond that had once sparkled in a lady 's ring lay in a field amid tall grasses and oxeye daisies Just above it was a big Dewdrop that clung timidly to a nodding grass-blade Overhead the blazing sun shone in all his noonday glory Ever since the first pink blush of dawn the modest Dewdrop had gazed fixedly down upon the rich gem but feared to address a person of such exalted consequence At last a large Beetle during his rambles chanced to espy the Diamond and he also recognised him to be some one of great rank and importance `` Sire '' he said making a low bow `` permit your humble servant to offer you greeting '' `` Tha -- nks '' responded the Diamond in languid tones of affectation As the Beetle raised his head from his profound bow his gaze happened to alight upon the Dewdrop `` A relative of yours I presume Sire '' he remarked affably waving one of his feelers in the direction of the Dewdrop The Diamond burst into a rude contemptuous laugh `` Quite _too_ absurd I declare '' he exclaimed loftily `` But there what _can_ you expect from a low grovelling beetle Away sir pass on Your very presence is distasteful to me The _idea_ of placing ME upon the same level -- in the same family as a low-born mean insignificant utterly valueless -- -- '' Here the Diamond fairly choked for breath `` But has he not beauty exactly like your own Sire '' the Beetle ventured to interpose though with a very timid air `` BEAU -- TY '' flashed the Diamond with fine disdain -- '' the impudent fellow merely apes and imitates ME However it is some small consolation to remember that 'Imitation is the sincerest flattery But even _allowing_ him to possess it mere beauty without _rank_ is ridiculous and worthless A Boat without _water_ -- a Carriage but no _horses_ -- a Well but never a _winch_ such is beauty without rank and wealth There is no _real worth_ apart from rank and wealth Combine Beauty Rank _and_ Wealth and you have the whole world at your feet Now you know the secret of the world worshipping ME '' And the Diamond sparkled and gleamed with vivid violet flashes so that the Beetle was glad to shade his eyes The poor Dewdrop had listened silently to all that had passed and felt so wounded that at last he wished he never had been born Slowly a bright tear fell and splashed the dust Just then a Skylark fluttered to the ground and eagerly darted his beak at the Diamond `` Alas '' he piped with a great sob of disappointment `` What I thought to be a precious dewdrop is only a worthless diamond My throat is parched for want of water I must die of thirst '' `` Really The world will never get over your loss '' cruelly sneered the Diamond But a sudden and noble resolve came to the Dewdrop Deeply did he repent his foolish wish _He could now lay down his life that the life of another might be saved '' May _I_ help you please '' he gently asked The Lark raised his drooping head `` Oh my precious precious friend if you will you can save my life '' `` Open your mouth then '' And the Dewdrop slid from the blade of grass tumbled into the parched beak and was eagerly swallowed `` Ah -- well well '' pondered the Beetle as he continued his homeward way `` I 've been taught a lesson that I shall not easily forget Yes yes Simple worth is far better than rank or wealth without modesty and unselfishness -- and there is no _true_ beauty where these virtues are absent ''
